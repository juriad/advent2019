Run as:

I have heard a lot about Ada's safety mechanism; it was pleasant to try them now.
I liked:

* defining types;
* attributes;
* arrays knowing first, last, range, length.

And I also didn't like:

* case sensitivity;
* types, function and variables sharing namespace;
* reading from file is annoying, it is too smart.
