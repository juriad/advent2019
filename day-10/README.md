Run as:
```
erlc prg.erl && erl -noshell -eval 'prg:tasks("input"),init:stop()'
```

The first task was very nice for Erlang since I could play with distributed exploration of asteroids.
The second half was annoying because of the sort.

Erlang is not a bad language; I had problems with:

* ifs, cases and semicolons,
* output,
* starting from command line (not as a shell).
