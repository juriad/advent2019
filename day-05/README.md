Run as:
```
fbc prg.bas && ./prg input
```

Basic is a bit easier than Fortran. There wasn't really anything that would surprise me.
Nice features are:

* changing array size by `ReDim`;
* functions for bounds of array;
* no statement terminators/separators.

Not so nice:

* separation of subroutines and functions;
* passing arrays needs `()`;
* weird choice of comment starter.
