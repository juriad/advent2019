Julia is quite a nice language, everything is an object, all calls are dynamic, it is fast.
It does not have methods as we know them because of the dynamic call mechanism.
Arrays are unfortunately indexed from 1. 
I liked the support for big numbers (Int128, UInt128, BigInt) and `modinv` was a nice perk too.
Julia is a big competition to Matlab (as a language), but lacks the environment and GUI.
