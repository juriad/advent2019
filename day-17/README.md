Run as:
```
go build prg.go && ./prg input
```

Go is a pretty nice language; I liked:

* `for` for everything;
* goroutines;
* definition of types (new, aliases, structs);
* automatic referencing;
* mandatory braces.

And not so much:

* return value of a function is written just after arguments;
* arrays and slices are weird;
* missing ternary operator, higher order functions.
