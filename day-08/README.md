Run as:
```
fpc prg.pas && ./prg input 25 6
```

Pascal was more annoying than I anticipaded, given that it was/is bradly used for teaching programming.
I didn't like:

* strings (too many types); 
* explicit separate definition of variables;
* begin-ends.

I liked:

* dynamic arrays (and defining their size by calling setLength).
