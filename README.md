# Progress

Each day I use a different programming language.

## Day 1 - AWK

Awk can do functions and it is pretty nice to work with. :-)

## Day 2 - XSLT

Thanks @marek for the suggestion. :-)
It is hell to work with XSLT, extremely verbose, hard to debug; it only has naive recursion.
It is so easy to make mistakes with XML. :-(

## Day 3 - Fortran

Thanks @PetrFanta for the suggestion. :-)

Fortran could have nicer way of reading inputs and use its obscure formats.
Once the input was read into a string (2.5 hours), the rest was easy (1 hour).
