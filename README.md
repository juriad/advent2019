# Progress

Each day I use a different programming language.

## Day 1 - AWK

Awk can do functions and it is pretty nice to work with. :-)

## Day 2 - XSLT

Thanks @marek for the suggestion. :-)
It is hell to work with XSLT, extremely verbose, hard to debug; it only has naive recursion.
It is so easy to make mistakes with XML. :-(

## Day 3 - Fortran

Thanks @PetrFanta for the suggestion. :-)

Fortran could have nicer way of reading inputs and use its obscure formats.
Once the input was read into a string (2.5 hours), the rest was easy (1 hour).

## Day 4 - Minizinc

Because the task was about modeling constraints, I for once chose a suitable language.
Solution took only a couple minutes.

## Day 5 - (Free)Basic

Again, I had to parse input manually; I am getting better at this.
The task itself was just a natural progression of day 2.

## Day 6 - (Common)Lisp

Revising finger-counting and adapting FP principles to LISP.

## Day 7 - (SWI)Prolog

I had to reimplement day 5 in another language.
Hardest task so far because of the second part which required changing the way programs are running.

## Day 8 - (Free)Pascal

A simple task quite well suited for the language of my choice.

## Day 9 - Lua

Yet another variation on virtual machine; nothing hard, finished surprisingly fast.
Lua is actually very comfortable language to write programs in.
