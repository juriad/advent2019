Run as:
```
dart prg.dart input
```

Dart is a nice language; its syntax takes the good parts from a lot of languages.
I was only missing the new trend of changing statements into expressions (mainly ifs and switches).
Dart has nice data structures; I did't need to implement dynamic lists nor queues.

Its disadvantage is that it is not progressive enough.
