Run as:
```
rustc prg.rs && ./prg input
```

Rust was a surprise; the language is incredibly hard to write in.
It feels like constant arguing with the compiler.
I encountered a lot of issues:

* iterate a hashmap while modifying it;
* struct with references to parts of itself;
* which traits actually exist and which are useful.

I can imagine using this language for projects where the code must be provably correct.

I don't see myself using it anytime soon.
It was clearly inspired by C, however it took the precision too far, like Scala in JVM environment.
