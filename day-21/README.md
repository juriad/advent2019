Run as:
```
ocamlc -o prg prg.ml && ./prg input
```

OCaml has very bad documentation of standard library, there are even competing ones.
Installation was also quite painful until I decided to go Opam all-the-way.

The syntax of OCaml is significantly worse than Haskell's.
Its benefit however is that it has mutable data structures.

I don't see myself using OCaml for any task.
