Run as:
```
swipl -s prg.pl -g 'task("input", 0), halt'
swipl -s prg.pl -g 'task("input", 5), halt'
```

Prolog is nice to work with.
The language being fully immutable and having a good interpretter allows easy iterative development.
One disadvantage is that it does not contain an array type which could improve performance.
