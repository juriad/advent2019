Run as:
```
rakudo prg.p6 input
```

I don't like Raku; the language has too many features which make it unnecessarily complicated:

* sigils, twigils - why?
* default variable;
* pointy block;
* reinventing regexes, again;
* lists, arrays - why is one mutable and not the other?
* lack of object constructors.

I liked: 

* unless, postfix if and unless;
* gather, take.
